Svelte application that allows user to sign up and create posts for their recipes. Recipes can be saved for individual 
users as well as through a community page that displays the most recent recipes that other users have posted. The frontend is created using SvelteKit
and Tailwind CSS. The backend code is written in Python using FastAPI and the database is MongoDB. Will eventually be a live website.
